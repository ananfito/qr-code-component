## My process

I started with the HTML file and built out the sections of the webpage starting with a `div` container for the image and text. Then I created a `div` specifically for the text. After that I moved on to styling. I opted to use flexbox to center the content vertically and horizontally, then used custom styling to create the appropriate rounded corners and font colors.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

For the most part, this challenge was a review exercise for me. Regardless, I did have a **big takeaway**: when using flexbox and centering content vertically you need to set the `height` parameter of the `body` to `100vh`. This is something I initially forgot to include in my styling sheet. It caused some frustration but I continued to style project until the very end I had to figure it out. Thankfully, I reviewed an old project where I accomplished the same goal and that's when I saw the `height: 100vh` which reminded me what I was missing.

### Continued development

While this was a review exercise for me, I do want to continue practicing my frontend skills. Specifically, I want to continue practicing HTML and CSS so they become second nature, then later incorporate more JavaScript.
